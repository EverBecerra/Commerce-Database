# Project Overview <!-- Purpose of the Project -->

This project introduces SQL fundamentals and uses a simplified commerce database. While designed as a beginner-friendly exercise, the schema incorporates multiple real processes, including orders, payments, and many aspects of business operations.


## Business Objective <!-- Goal of the Project -->

In this database, the goal of the project is to practice SQL skills through schema validation, data insertion, and queries that simulate common business questions in a commerce environment. 


## Database Constraints 

- Beginner-level database design 
- Some business constraints may not be represented 
- Analysis is limited due to the small sample size
- Data minimum (â‰¥ 3 rows per table)
- Every table has a PK
- Many-to-many relationships have a composite entity 


## Project Process

1. **Design Phase**
    - The database design was influenced by e-commerce businesses such as Amazon and Wayfair.
    - Focused on identifying key entities and relationships needed for a commerce environment.

2. **Implementation Process**
    - Established business rules to determine the required tables and relationships.
    - Constructed PK and FK constraints to enforce referential integrity.
    - Inserted a minimum of 3 rows per table, resulting in a total of 72 inserts.

3. **Validation Process** 
    - Ran a query that confirmed that each table met the minimum number of inserts.
    - Verified that PK and FK relationships were correctly enforced 

4. **Analysis Phase**
    - Developed analytical queries to simulate real-world business questions. 


## Schema and Inserts 

The schema was implemented in `schema_and_inserts.sql`, which contains:
- Table creation with PK, FK, and constraints.
- Sample data

  <summary><b>Query 1: Data Sample Validation Count</b></summarr>
    
```sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(*) = 0 THEN 'All tables have >= 3 rows'
        ELSE 'Some tables have fewer than 3 rows'
    END AS `Insert Check`
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'dbms_project'
  AND table_rows < 3;
```
