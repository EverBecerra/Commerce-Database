# Project Overview <!-- Purpose of the Project -->

This project introduces SQL fundamentals and uses a simplified commerce database. While designed as a beginner-friendly exercise, the schema incorporates multiple real processes, including orders, payments, and many aspects of business operations.

## Business Objective <!-- Goal of the Project -->

In this database, the goal of the project is to practice SQL skills through schema validation, data insertion, and queries that simulate common business questions in a commerce environment. 

## Database Constraints 

- Beginner-level database design 
- Some business constraints may not be represented 
- Analysis is limited due to the small sample size
- Data minimum (â‰¥ 3 rows per table)
- Every table has a PK
- Many-to-many relationships have a composite entity
