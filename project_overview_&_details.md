# Project Overview

This project introduces SQL fundamentals and uses a simplified commerce database. While designed as a beginner-friendly exercise, the schema incorporates multiple real processes, including orders, payments, and many aspects of business operations.

## Business Objective 

In this database, the goal of the project is to practice SQL skills through schema validation, data insertion, and queries that simulate common business questions in a commerce environment. 

## Database Constraints 

-- Beginner-level database design 
-- Some business constraints may not be represented 
-- Analysis is limited due to the small sample size
