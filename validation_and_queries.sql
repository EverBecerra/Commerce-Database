 Data Manipulation Language (DML) & Data Definition Language (DDL) queries
 For this particular query we specifically called to drop all instances of Brandon where the first name equals Brandon
 Since ON DELETE CASCADE was not originally defined, MySQL defaults to ON DELETE RESTRICT,
 which prevents deleting a parent row while child rows still reference it.
 Steps to follow:
   1. Find the FK constraint name on the table using the reference 
   2. Drop the existing FK
   3. Generate a new FK with the CASCADE
***/


-- Step 1: Find the FK constraint linking driver to employees
SELECT 
	constraint_name 						    #Name of the FK/PK/Constraint
FROM 
	information_schema.key_column_usage			#Metadata mapping key columns and their references 
WHERE 
	table_schema = 'dbms_project' 				#Database containing the child table
    AND table_name = 'driver' 					#Child table containing the FK we want to modify 
    AND referenced_table_name = 'employees';	#Parent table the FK points to 

-- Step 2: Drop the existing FK from driver
ALTER TABLE driver							
DROP FOREIGN KEY driver_ibfk_1;

-- Step 3: Recreate FK with cascade rules
ALTER TABLE driver 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_driver_employee
FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;    -- Cascades delete and update actions to child table


-- Repeat for related tables
ALTER TABLE vehicle_fulfillment
DROP FOREIGN KEY vehicle_fulfillment_ibfk_2;

ALTER TABLE vehicle_fulfillment
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_vehicle_fulfillment_driver 
FOREIGN KEY (driver_id) REFERENCES driver(driver_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE delivery
DROP FOREIGN KEY delivery_ibfk_1;

ALTER TABLE delivery
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_delivery_vehicle_fulfillment
FOREIGN KEY (vehicle_id) REFERENCES vehicle_fulfillment(vehicle_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE fulfillment_method
DROP FOREIGN KEY fulfillment_method_ibfk_1;

ALTER TABLE fulfillment_method
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_fulfillment_method_delivery
FOREIGN KEY (delivery_id) REFERENCES delivery(delivery_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE pick_up_location
DROP FOREIGN KEY pick_up_location_ibfk_1;

ALTER TABLE pick_up_location
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_pick_up_location_vehicle_fulfillment
FOREIGN KEY (vehicle_id) REFERENCES vehicle_fulfillment(vehicle_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
