## üõ†Ô∏è Query 2: FK Reconstructions and Cascading Deletion

Reconstructed a foreign key with ON DELETE CASCADE to enable deletion of parent rows while preserving referential integrity.

Steps to follow:
   1. Find the FK constraint name on the table using the reference 
   2. Drop the existing FK
   3. Generate a new FK with the CASCADE

```sql
SELECT 
	constraint_name 						    #Name of the FK/PK/Constraint
FROM 
	information_schema.key_column_usage			#Metadata mapping key columns and their references 
WHERE table_schema = 'dbms_project' 			#Database containing the child table
    AND table_name = 'driver' 					#Child table containing the FK we want to modify 
    AND referenced_table_name = 'employees';	#Parent table the FK points to 

-- Step 2: Drop the existing FK from driver
ALTER TABLE driver							
DROP FOREIGN KEY driver_ibfk_1;

-- Step 3: Recreate FK with cascade rules
ALTER TABLE driver 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_driver_employee
FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;    -- Cascades delete and update actions to child table


-- Repeat for related tables
ALTER TABLE vehicle_fulfillment
DROP FOREIGN KEY vehicle_fulfillment_ibfk_2;

ALTER TABLE vehicle_fulfillment
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_vehicle_fulfillment_driver 
FOREIGN KEY (driver_id) REFERENCES driver(driver_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE delivery
DROP FOREIGN KEY delivery_ibfk_1;

ALTER TABLE delivery
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_delivery_vehicle_fulfillment
FOREIGN KEY (vehicle_id) REFERENCES vehicle_fulfillment(vehicle_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE fulfillment_method
DROP FOREIGN KEY fulfillment_method_ibfk_1;

ALTER TABLE fulfillment_method
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_fulfillment_method_delivery
FOREIGN KEY (delivery_id) REFERENCES delivery(delivery_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE pick_up_location
DROP FOREIGN KEY pick_up_location_ibfk_1;

ALTER TABLE pick_up_location
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_pick_up_location_vehicle_fulfillment
FOREIGN KEY (vehicle_id) REFERENCES vehicle_fulfillment(vehicle_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Deleting by name in production environments is risky‚Äîconsider using the primary key instead.
```sql
-- Disable safe updates (allows deletes without key filters)
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0; 

-- Demo delete: remove all employees named Brandon
-- (For demo only ‚Äî in production, delete by primary key)
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE first_name = 'Brandon';
